## 📝 Usage Guide

### 🔹 Encrypt a File
Encrypt a file using the `encrypt_file` function:

```python
from ciphersentry import CipherSentry

cs = CipherSentry()
encrypted_file = cs.encrypt_file("example.txt")
```

### 🔹 Decrypt a File
Decrypt an encrypted file:

```python
cs.decrypt_file("example.txt.enc")
```

### 🔹 Generate RSA-4096 Key Pair
Generate a public-private key pair for secure communication:

```python
cs.generate_rsa_keys()
```

### 🔹 AI Intrusion Detection
Detect potential security breaches using AI-powered anomaly detection:

```python
system_logs = ["Failed login attempt", "Root access request"]
cs.detect_intrusion(system_logs)
```

### 🔹 Self-Destruct a File
Securely delete sensitive files:

```python
cs.self_destruct("example.txt.enc")
```

### 🔹 Decentralized Key Storage (Blockchain Integration)
Store your RSA public keys on the blockchain for enhanced security:

```python
cs.blockchain_store_key(public_key)
```

## 🔐 How It Works

CipherSentry combines encryption, AI anomaly detection, and blockchain technology to provide a comprehensive security solution:

- **Encryption:** Files are encrypted using AES-256 for symmetric encryption and RSA-4096 for asymmetric encryption.
- **AI-Powered Intrusion Detection:** Uses machine learning models to analyze system logs and detect potential breaches.
- **Blockchain Key Storage:** Public keys are stored securely on the blockchain, making them tamper-resistant and accessible only by authorized parties.
- **Self-Destruct Mechanism:** Once triggered, the tool securely deletes encrypted files to ensure data privacy.

## 📈 Planned Features

- **Dark Web Scanning:** Scan for leaked encryption keys and other sensitive data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Authentication:** Enhance privacy and security with zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Automated Forensic Analysis:** Use AI and blockchain to automatically analyze security breaches and file tampering.
