# CipherSentry - AI-Powered Encryption & Threat Detection 🛡️🔐

CipherSentry is an advanced **encryption management and AI-powered threat detection** tool designed to secure sensitive data and detect unauthorized access attempts in real-time. It uses **military-grade encryption** algorithms (AES-256 & RSA-4096) and integrates **AI-driven anomaly detection** to identify suspicious activity.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AES-256 & RSA-4096 Encryption**: Encrypts files and messages with top-tier encryption algorithms.
- **AI-Driven Anomaly Detection**: Detects unauthorized access and intrusion attempts in real-time using machine learning.
- **Decentralized Key Storage**: Utilizes blockchain for secure, tamper-proof key storage.
- **Self-Destruct Mechanism**: Securely deletes sensitive files to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Stealth Mode**: Operates silently to avoid detection during operation.

## 🛠️ Installation

To get started with CipherSentry, you'll need **Python 3.x** and the following dependencies:

```sh
pip install cryptography tensorflow requests
📝 Usage Guide
🔹 Encrypt a File
To encrypt a file, use the encrypt_file function. For example:

python
Copiar código
from ciphersentry import CipherSentry

cs = CipherSentry()
encrypted_file = cs.encrypt_file("example.txt")
🔹 Decrypt a File
To decrypt an encrypted file:

python
Copiar código
cs.decrypt_file("example.txt.enc")
🔹 Generate RSA-4096 Key Pair
Generate a public-private key pair for secure communication:

python
Copiar código
cs.generate_rsa_keys()
🔹 AI Intrusion Detection
Detect potential security breaches using AI-powered anomaly detection:

python
Copiar código
system_logs = ["Failed login attempt", "Root access request"]
cs.detect_intrusion(system_logs)
🔹 Self-Destruct a File
If you need to delete sensitive files securely:

python
Copiar código
cs.self_destruct("example.txt.enc")
🔹 Decentralized Key Storage (Blockchain Integration)
Store your RSA public keys on the blockchain for added security:

python
Copiar código
cs.blockchain_store_key(public_key)
🔐 How It Works
CipherSentry combines encryption, AI anomaly detection, and blockchain technology to provide a comprehensive security solution.

Encryption: Files are encrypted with AES-256 for symmetric encryption and RSA-4096 for asymmetric encryption.

AI-Powered Intrusion Detection: Uses machine learning models to analyze system logs and detect potential breaches.

Blockchain Key Storage: Public keys are stored securely on the blockchain, making them tamper-resistant and accessible only by authorized parties.

Self-Destruct Mechanism: Once triggered, the tool will securely delete encrypted files to ensure data privacy.

📈 Planned Features
Dark Web Scanning: Scan for leaked encryption keys and other sensitive data.

Zero-Knowledge Proof Authentication: Enhance privacy and security with zero-knowledge proofs.

Automated Forensic Analysis: Use AI and blockchain to automatically analyze security breaches and file tampering.

🔒 Why Choose CipherSentry?
CipherSentry provides the perfect blend of advanced encryption and AI-powered security. With its stealth mode, AI anomaly detection, and blockchain-based key storage, CipherSentry is the ultimate tool for privacy-conscious individuals and organizations.
